# CS516 Homework 1

**Forked from:** [greyli/albumy](https://github.com/greyli/albumy)  
**Changes:** Added ML features for alternate text generation and image search.


---

## Project Overview

This project extends the Albumy web application by adding machine learning features.

- **Alt Text Generation:** Generates descriptive alternative text using the Azure Vision API if users do not provide their own descriptions.  
- **Object Detection in images & Image Search:** Detects objects in images, tags them, and tag-based search.

- **Alt text gen commit url:** https://github.com/nidhi919/CS516_albumy_NidhiRJ/commit/b7aa65e
- **Image search commit url:** https://github.com/nidhi919/CS516_albumy_NidhiRJ/commit/5c75da5

The application is built with **Python**, **Flask**, and **SQLAlchemy**, and relies on Azure Vision API for ML functionality.
